# Perceptions of Domestic Abuse Internationally
by Krithika Ramanathan

Domestic Abuse has been a very prevelant issue throughout our history but the awarness of this issue has only recently gathered the visibility it deserves. GLobally, over 30% of women over the age of 15 experience domestic abuse and a majority of this is concentrated within lower and middle class countries. A majority of these countries follow a patriarchal social structure which imposes political and religous values that condone misogyny. 

In this study, I decided to analyze attitudes towards physical violence perpetrated by a partner against women. Perceptions of deomestic abuse are oe of the greatest factors associated with perpetration and most importantly the responses women receive as a victims of this form of perpetration. 

The goal of this analysis was to identify what kinds of demographics within lower and middle class countries contributed to the highest percentage of justification of domestic abuse. After reaching certain conclusions from this analysis, I decided to expand my analysis to explore how education levels may also affect perceptions of domestic abuse and how this correlates with my inital analysis 


### Data Scraping
The data I gathered was aquired from UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster's Survey. This survey excompasses various sets of data that track progress of women's health and development in middle and lower income countries. The data that I specifically chose was the "Attitudes towards Wife Beating" data set that tracked both men's and women's perceptions towards wife beating.The data collected by UNICEF followed a multistage clustering technique that encompessed about 5,000-40,000 households intra-nationally. Attitudes towards domestic abuse were measured by 5 indicators: "(1) she goes out without telling him, (2) she neglects the children, (3) she argues with him, (4) she refuses to have sex with him, (5) she burns the food." These questions were replicated for both men and women and remained constant if not slightly tweaked internationally to match national sentiments of women's roles within the country.
